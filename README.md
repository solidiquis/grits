# Grits

Grits is simple and easy-to-use line text-processor that applies regular expressions with named captures to input lines
and transforms them using a custom template string. It allows for efficient parsing, extracting, and formatting of text,
including support for colorization and other attributes you'd get using ANSI escape sequences.
